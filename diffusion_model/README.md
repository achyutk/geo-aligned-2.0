The code in this folder is used to finetune a stable diffusion model. The code was taken by the youtuber: [WizzityGen](https://www.youtube.com/@wizzitygen)

A clear explaination of the code is done by him in [his video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWBwbLua3P4).

The images used to train this dataset were taken from snapshots of the show "Mira The Detective." I do not own any rights to those snapshots, and their use is solely for academic purposes. The images are not be made public.
